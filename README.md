Doe's Exceed fan website! I want this website to do multiple things to benefit the Exceed community:

1. Compile fan-made content such as characters, playmats and rules
2. Compile strategy and character guides, searchable and sortable by content and subject matter
3. Compile local scenes and their locations, events and tournmanets with their details and results
4. Act as an index for players, what local scenes they are in, their favored characters, player bios and tournament results, with a search function that can filter players by these details
5. Feature a blog for opinions pieces, game news and community roundups

This is a real mess because I don't know web development and I'm learning as I go.

## To Do

1. BEGIN STYLING PAGES. I don't want to throw a bunch of content on before I know how to format it nicely.
2. CREATE SEARCH FUNCTION. I need a generic search function that will be used for multiple things, but right now certainly guides and players.
