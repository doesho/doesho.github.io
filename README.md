# PLAY MORE EXCEED | playexceed.com
Doe's Exceed fan website! I want this website to do multiple things to benefit the Exceed community:

1. Compile fan-made content such as characters, playmats and rules
2. Compile strategy and character guides, searchable and sortable by content and subject matter
3. Compile local scenes and their locations, events and tournmanets with their details and results
4. Act as an index for players, what local scenes they are in, their favored characters, player bios and tournament results, with a search function that can filter players by these details
5. Feature a blog for opinions pieces, game news and community roundups

This is a real mess because I don't know web development and I'm learning as I go.

## To Do

1. FINISH STYLING GUIDE ENTRIES. They're not half bad but they should be comfortably done before adding all the guides in.
2. NEW FRONT PAGE HEADER. cool character scroll or something behind PMX logo.
3. BEGIN ANOTHER PAGE. Guides has come along smashingly. Get started on another main page.
