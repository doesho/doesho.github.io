# PLAY MORE EXCEED | playexceed.com
savory's Exceed fan website! I want this website to do multiple things to benefit the Exceed community:

1. Compile (and host?) downloadable fan-made content such as characters, playmats and rules
2. Compile strategy and character guides, searchable and sortable by content and subject matter
3. Compile local scenes and their locations, events and tournaments with their details and results
4. Act as an index for players, what local scenes they are in, their favored characters, player bios and tournament results, with a search function that can filter players by these details
5. Feature a blog for opinion pieces, game news and community roundups

This is a real mess because I don't know web development and I'm learning as I go. The project will have to shift away from being a static website to enable account creation. Users can manage their own pages and add their own local scenes and tournaments to the respective pages. Guides and fan content can also be attributed to that user, showing on their page (making players also sortable/findable by this).
