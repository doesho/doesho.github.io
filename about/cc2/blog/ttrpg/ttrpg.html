                    <p>
                        I've been really enjoying the newest generation of My Little Pony. Although the writing is less impressive than Friendship is
                        Magic, the characters are very appealing, and the main plot has been interesting all the way through - especially Misty's redemption
                        arc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I often wonder what fantastical, over the top direction the story could go, and although I know it plays too safe to get wild, I
                        always fantasize about it heading into some wild, expressive, anime-esque territory. The foundation of the plot's intrigue allows
                        for such amazing ideas, I can't help but imagine what I would write.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        At the end of Chapter 5, Opaline finally achieved her goal of draining Sparky's magic, and now has her sights set on acquiring more
                        dragonfire, straight from the source - with the reintroduction of magic into the world, the dragons are awakening from hibernation.
                        As a fire alicorn, such powerful magic fire is the perfect source of fuel for her own fire magic, so she leaves her dark castle to
                        head directly to the desolate Dragonlands.
                    </p>
                    <div class="EntryBodySection">
                        <p>WHAT I WOULD WRITE...</p>
                        <hr />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Among the dragons arising, the most mysterious and powerful is their leader, calling himself Nightshade. Smaller than other dragons,
                        and distinctly humanoid, he is a cloaked figure with broad shoulders and a commanding presence. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Suddenly, the tables have turned. Opaline is again powerless, and far away from her dark tower, she has no choice but to accept defeat.
                        Misty, reflecting on the flickers of humanity Opaline has shown, pleads for her sparing, showing that its her fear of powerlessness - her
                        weakness - that drives her desire. The Mane 5 sympathize and extend the olive branch, which Opaline begrudgingly accepts. They escape in the
                        Marestream.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now united, if only temporarily, they must work together to defeat Nightshade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's revealed Nightshade is Spike. Him and Twilight both outlived their friends, and with even ???'s passing, he couldn't take it. He fled
                        from the pony world and back to the Dragonlands. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the finale, all hope seems lost. Despite fighting to the last, Opaline and the Mane 5 are defeated, and it seems Nightshade has won. The
                        only one left is Sparky, defenseless and scared, while Hitch cries for him to run. Nightshade appeals to Sparky... But he defies him. Pipp,
                        slowly joined by the others, sing his song - A Special Tune. In a symbolic white void, Nightshade speaks to Sparky about his tale. 
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But in Sparky, who stands defiant in front of his friends, he sees himself, with his own friends all those years ago.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Explaining</h2>
                    <p>
                        Of course, the temptation to make the plot "Twilight Sparkle wants to turn the world back to FiM times" is incredibly tempting, ripping the
                        plot of Shadowbringers wholesale. It would fit even better that she's the Princess of Friendship, and outlived all her friends by centuries;
                        and for bronies it would help symoblize not wanting to let G4 go.
                        However, it's wise to avoid painting Twilight as an antagonist, even for sympathetic and literary reasons, as I think most wouldn't appreciate
                        it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's perhaps a bit trite, but I have a soft spot for this sort of thing, and I think it would be the perfect level for My
                        Little Pony. Children, especially girls, are often disrespected by their media, and something approaching Final Fantasy or Sailor
                        Moon is exactly the level of complexity and drama that children's content should aim to be.
