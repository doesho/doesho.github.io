                                and reveals a few projects coming in early 2025. However, Exceed is entirely absent from the video. Shortly after the video's publication, Brad made this comment
                                in the Level 99 Games Exceed channel;

                                Fans speculate that Guilty Gear Strive: The Board Game was not a financial success due to multiple factors, most infamously the miscolored card backs. However, a retail-scale
                                <b>Strive Season 2</b> is still a strong possibilty, as well as a <b>Seventh Cross season reprint</b> or rebalance that was hinted at last August. Finally, a previous 
                                survey suggested <b>Bullet</b> Exceed was under consideration.

                                This addon is loaded on top of the Exceed Fighting System: Complete, while you're at the table. It automatically displays what cards are possible for

                                Using the Godot engine, DT has captured the core gameplay and implemented all of season 7, plus a few characters from
                                season 6 and 5, with more coming down the line. There's netplay with a lobby and matchmaking, as well as bot support,
                                so you can always be playing when your boss or teacher isn't looking!

                                We'll see if the life cycle of this beautiful project ends in a DMCA, giving it the
                                honorable death of all great fan projects. If not, we just might see this client come to
                                replace Tabletop Simulator as the usual way to play Exceed online.

                                The day has come... Tirankin's tabletop simulator module, the addon that keeps Exceed glued together, has changed its funny name to something more normal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Formerly known as <b>XFS: Balanced Breakfast</b>, the module is now known as <b>Exceed Fighting System: Complete</b>, with a new image featuring the logos
                                of Exceed's season IPs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The origin of "Balanced Breakfast" comes from Level 99 Games' <i>BattleCON</i>, their first fighting card game. The name BattleCON sounds like Bacon, and Exceed
                                sounds like Eggs, thus bacon and eggs.

                                The immediate response has been greatly positive, with special praise given to the faithfulness of their adaptation and the potential for each

                                A recent conversation in the Level 99 Games Discord has hinted at a possible rebalance and reprint of Season 2.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <b>champ21bell:</b><i>"I saw you mentioning reprints earlier too...any chance you'd be making an announcement about the 'rebalancing' soon @Brad"</i><br />
                                <b>champ21bell:</b><i>"Sorry if this is a spoiler^"</i><br />
                                <b>Brad:</b> <i>"We were talking at EVO a bit about a reprint of S2 and tweaking a few cards if we did a reprint, but I don't know if I'd call that a "rebalance".</i>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Multiple people have said Season 2 would need templating changes and more than 'tweaking a few cards' to reach modern balance standards. Nothing further is known about this.
