                During the Q&amp;A section of the June 26<sup>th</sup> <a href="https://youtu.be/D4sL69ucjhI?t=3712">Level Up Live</a>, youtube user Jonathan Is Champ asked <i>"What about season 7 of exceed??"</i> Brad and Marco of Level 99 Games responded;
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Marco:</b> <i>"Chat is asking 'What about Season 7 of Exceed?' Just you wait, that's the answer to that one! Just you wait!"</i><br />
                <b>Brad:</b> <i>"We're going to announce news about Exceed in the near future. So wait up, you won't be disappointed."</i>

                The company's previous statement was that Season 7 would be announced following Dead By Daylight finishing fulfillment. In the May 30th Level Up Live<sup>[link?]</sup>, Brad said he has a prototype in-hand for their "next project", which is debuting
                on Kickstarter in August. Some speculation believes this will be Season 7.

                As far as IP speculation, the leading assumption is <b>Guilty Gear -Strive-</b>, which is developed by Arc System Works, the creators of BlazBlue and publishers of both BlazBlue and Under Night In-Birth. The project name for Season 7 is <i>Bald Eagle</i>,
                a possible reference to the bald eagle shown flying before every match of Guilty Gear -Strive-. It may also reference the game's themes of personal freedom and the prominence of the United States in the game's main story.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides Guilty Gear, further bald eagle related guesses have included G.I. Joe and My Hero Academia - the latter of which is owned by Jasco, who Level 99 Games have worked with in the past. Brad has expressed reluctance on working with them again after a transfer of ownership, however.<sup>[source?]</sup>
