            <h3>"New Project" in collaboration with ArcSys to be announced at EVO</h3>
            <h4>News -- July 31, 2023</h4>

                Level 99 Games is a guest at EVO, the world's premier fighting game tournament convention, at Arc System Work's booth. Alongside running demos for Exceed, Brad stated they will be announcing their new project, in collaboration with Arc System Works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brad revealed that demos of this new project will be given out for free at the booth and will be available for free on the official website (shipping not included), starting 10am on Friday, August 4th.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the Breakfast Club Exceed server, former Exceed developer D (Tirankin) stated;
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <b>Tirankin:</b> <i>"Folks should keep their eyes and ears open on August 4th"</i><br />
                <b>Tirankin:</b> <i>"Just if you happen to be watching things like fighting game tournamnets or Vox Media news outlets, then"</i><br />
                <b>Tirankin:</b> <i>"I'm pretty sure that's all I currently have permission to say"</i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This heavily suggests not only is Tirankin involved in the some part of Season 7 behind the scenes, but that the project being announced at EVO will indeed be Exceed, as this was posted to an Exceed-specific fan server.

                During the Q&amp;A section of the June 26<sup>th</sup> <a href="https://youtu.be/D4sL69ucjhI?t=3712">Level Up Live</a>, youtube user Jonathan Is Champ asked <i>"What about season 7 of exceed??"</i> Brad and Marco of Level 99 Games responded;
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <b>Marco:</b> <i>"Chat is asking 'What about Season 7 of Exceed?' Just you wait, that's the answer to that one! Just you wait!"</i><br />
                <b>Brad:</b> <i>"We're going to announce news about Exceed in the near future. So wait up, you won't be disappointed."</i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The company's previous statement was that Season 7 would be announced following Dead By Daylight finishing fulfillment. In the May 30th Level Up Live<sup>[link?]</sup>, Brad said he has a prototype in-hand for their "next project", which is debuting
                on Kickstarter in August. Some speculation believes this will be Season 7.

            <h3>What will the IP be?</h3>
            </div>
        <div class="BlogEntryBody">
            <p>
                As far as IP speculation, the leading assumption is <b>Guilty Gear -Strive-</b>, which is developed by Arc System Works, the creators of BlazBlue and publishers of both BlazBlue and Under Night In-Birth. The project name for Season 7 is <i>Bald Eagle</i>,
                a possible reference to the bald eagle shown flying before every match of Guilty Gear -Strive-. It may also reference the game's themes of personal freedom and the prominence of the United States in the game's main story.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides Guilty Gear, further bald eagle related guesses have included G.I. Joe and My Hero Academia - the latter of which is owned by Jasco, who Level 99 Games have worked with in the past. Brad has expressed reluctance on working with them again after a transfer of ownership, however.<sup>[source?]</sup>
