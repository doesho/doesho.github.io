                    I've finally watched all of Friendship is Magic, as I fell out of bronydom around season 6. Since Everfree Northwest is still active, I've started attending and fulfilling that
                    childhood dream. It's funny seeing comments on brony songs and videos saying things like "Sad the good days of the fandom are gone" from 6 years ago - a time anyone in 2023 would be jealous to be in.<br />

                        "It is said what is called "the spirit of an age" is something to which one cannot return. That this spirit gradually dissipates is due to the world's coming to an end.
                        In the same way, a single year does not have just spring or summer. A single day, too, is the same.<br />
                        For this reason, although one would like to change today's world to the spirit of one hundred years or more ago, it cannot be done. Thus it is important to make the best
                        out of every generation. This is the mistake of people who are attached to past generations. They have no understanding of this point."

                    In the same way, to say ponies is dead in 2023 - when people still make songs, attend conventions, sell art - is just as funny.

                        "Everyone lets the present moment slip by, then looks for it as though he thought it was somewhere else. No one seems to have noticed this fact."

                    The amount of interpersonal conflict people have is deeply saddening. It seems now more than ever people are driven to seek pointless, petty fights.
                    This is something I've focused on in my studies on compassion. As Stephen Mitchell writes in his translation of the Tao Te Ching;<br />
                    <quoteblock>
                        "Unencumbered by any concept of sin, the master doesn't see evil as a force to resist, but simply as an opaqueness; a state of self-absorption which is in disharmony
                        with the universal process, so that as with a dirty window the light cannot shine through. This freedom from moral catagories allows him his great compassion for the wicked and
                        the selfish. Thus, the master is available to all people, and doesn't reject anyone. [...] this is called embodying the light."
