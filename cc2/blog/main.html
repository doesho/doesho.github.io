                        I've finally watched all of Friendship is Magic, as I fell out of bronydom around season 6. Since Everfree Northwest is still active, I've started attending, and it has rekindled a
                        fulfilling sense of belonging. It's funny seeing comments on brony songs and videos saying things like "Sad the good days of the fandom are gone" from 6 years ago - a time anyone in 2023 would be jealous to be in.

                    <blockquote>
                        "It is said what is called "the spirit of an age" is something to which one cannot return. That this spirit gradually dissipates is due to the world's coming to an end.
                        In the same way, a single year does not have just spring or summer. A single day, too, is the same.<br />
                        For this reason, although one would like to change today's world to the spirit of one hundred years or more ago, it cannot be done. Thus it is important to make the best
                        out of every generation. This is the mistake of people who are attached to past generations. They have no understanding of this point."

                    <p>In the same way, to say ponies is dead in 2023 - when people still make songs, attend conventions, sell art - is just as funny.</p>

                        The following is an old post from the previous version of this website. Not every post is worth bringing back, but I think this one is.

                        I've taken up skateboarding in the past few months, and it's been very enriching. I love dexterity challenges, and riding around on a plank of wood 
                        with wheels is about as dangerous and demanding one can get. I've been practicing dropping in; the act of starting atop a ramp, skateboard hung over the drop, 
                        then mounting and descending on the board in one motion, shooting down the ramp and into the park with speed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The lesson this teaches is about fear. The drop is scary, and you feel you will fall forward off the board. However, show any hesitation and you will undoubtedly 
                        fall backwards off the board instead - a potentially far worse way to fall. When you drop in, and lean very far forward, you will find it incredibly easy and that 
                        there was nothing to fear at all; yet hesitation to fear spells a worse failure than you could have imagined. It's like the saying
