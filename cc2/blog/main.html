                        A poet is a musician that can't sing. Words have to find a man's mind before they can touch his heart,
                        and some men's minds are woefully small targets. Music touches their hearts directly no matter how small
                        or stubborn the mind of the man who listens.

                        If I cannot enjoy something deeply, often I do not bother. For example, I cannot enjoy a story or picture only because it is cute or fun. It must mean something, it must have deep artistry; or failing this, it must have some
                        interesting history or story around its creation. With everything I enjoy, I can discuss the folding layers of its intricacies, whether intrinstic or extrinsic.

                        Yet so many people don't feel this way. People like ponies or fashion dolls simply because they are cute, and nothing further. They might know more about them, but they don't need to.

                        I admire this trait, and I lament not being that way. My own attitude - though it has driven me to great heights of understanding - comes in part from my neuroticism. It reveals an inner turmoil, and my failing in the Way. It
                        makes me impatient, driven to always do and go deeper, pushing me away from the peace and truth of how things <i>are.</i>

                        I've been enamored with the <i>I have no enemies</i> meme that has been going around. This sort of thinking is the most excellent
                        and powerful virtue. All other teachings of philosophy and science pale in significance to this simple virtue of compassion.
                        In the Hagakure, a book filled with killing, honor, war and such, the retired samurai Tsunetomo writes;
                    </p>

                        That this stoic, gruff samurai traditionalist would say such a thing is compelling and shows his true understanding of good living. This
                        is a fundamental teaching of most eastern philosophy, and part of its origin can be seen in the Tao Te Ching. Stephen Mitchell comments
                        on this in his translation;
                    </p>
                    <blockquote title="Preface of the Tao Te Ching, translated by Stephen Mitchells">
                        "The teaching of the Tao Te Ching is moral in the deepest sense. Unencumbered by any concept of sin, the Master doesn't see evil as a force
                        to resist, but simply as an opaqueness; a state of self-absorption which is in disharmony with the universal process, so that, as with a
                        dirty window, the light can't shine through."

                        Anybody can tell you that other people are just people too, who have their own issues, and even the most troubled and dangerous are this way.
                        But to embody this understanding is true strength, which takes a lifetime to master. I tear up just writing this. I hope to have that
                        strength some day.

                        I've finally watched all of Friendship is Magic, as I fell out of bronydom around season 6. Since Everfree Northwest is still active, I've started attending, and it has rekindled a
                        fulfilling sense of belonging. It's funny seeing comments on brony songs and videos saying things like "Sad the good days of the fandom are gone" from 6 years ago - a time anyone in 2023 would kill to be in.

                        The following is an old post from the previous version of this website. Not every post is worth bringing back, but I think this one is.
                    </p>

                        I've taken up skateboarding in the past few months, and it's been very enriching. I love dexterity challenges, and riding around on a plank of wood
                        with wheels is about as dangerous and demanding one can get. I've been practicing dropping in; the act of starting atop a ramp, skateboard hung over the drop,
                        then mounting and descending on the board in one motion, shooting down the ramp and into the park with speed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The lesson this teaches is about fear. The drop is scary, and you feel you will fall forward off the board and down the ramp. However, show any hesitation and
                        you will undoubtedly fall backwards off the board instead - a far more dangerous way to fall. If you drop in, and lean very far forward despite feeling you will fall,
                        you will find it incredibly easy and that there was nothing to fear at all; yet hesitation to fear spells a worse failure than you could have imagined. It's like the saying

                                    I was speechless in this section of the story, and this music was perhaps the biggest reason why.
                                    The intense, mournful longing of the tragic Mare Lamentorum first half is perfectly shown in this song.

                                    This song stands out as a vaporwave treasure with its somber yet optimistic tone. To me, it is not a criticism
                                    or attack like most vaporwave. Using homey personal footage of beautiful shopping centers, it says:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <i style="color: brown">
                                        It was fun what we
                                        shared, and if only things could have stayed so simple.
                                    </i>

                                <p>
                                    It's audible nostalgia - not that it takes you back, blind to
                                    the present moment - but instead stays here and looks back soberly, yet so longingly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I used this song on the previous version of this website, so it's become a sort of theme song. Fittingly, I think.

                                    I adore relaxing, jazzy songs, and the Spongebob soundtrack is a treasure trove. Although I haven't watched it since I was a child, I love
                                    hour-long compilation videos of the soundtrack to put on in the background. This is one of the few I've taken into my own playlists.

                                <p>
                                    This song is catchy and perfectly embodies the carefree feeling of 50's Tiki culture. It's so cute.
                                </p>

                                    Duster is a classic slowcore band I've recently found thanks to memes. This song is my second favorite of theirs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There's a simple peacefulness to it that never fails to put me at ease. It's like the optimistic ending to a melancholy story; closing on a heartfelt, hard-fought, subtle smile.
