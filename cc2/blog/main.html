                <p>The amount of interpersonal conflict people have is deeply saddening. It seems now more than ever people are driven to seek pointless, petty fights. 
                This is something I've focused on in my studies on compassion. As Stephen Mitchell writes in his translation of the Tao Te Ching;<br />
                <div class="Quote">"Unencumbered by any concept of sin, the master doesn't see evil as a force to resist, but simply as an opaqueness; a state of self-absorption which is in disharmony
                    with the universal process, so that as with a dirty window the light cannot shine through. This freedom from moral catagories allows him his great compassion for the wicked and
                    the selfish. Thus, the master is available to all people, and doesn't reject anyone. [...] this is called embodying the light."</div>
