                        I've been enamored with the <i>I have no enemies</i> meme that has been going around. This sort of thinking is the most excellent
                        and powerful virtue. All other teachings of philosophy and science pale in significance to this simple virtue of compassion.
                        In the Hagakure, a book filled with killing, honor, war and such, the retired samurai Tsunetomo writes;
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "What is called generosity is really compassion. In the Shin'ei it is written, 'Seen from the eye of compassion, there is no one
                        to be disliked. One who has sinned is to be pitied all the more.' 
                        <b>
                            There is no limit to the breadth and depth of one's heart.
                            There is room enough for all.
                        </b>"
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        "The wisdom and courage that come from compassion are real wisdom and courage. When one punishes or strives with the heart of
                        compassion, what he does will be limitless in strength and correctness. Doing something for one's own sake is shallow and mean
                        and turns into evil. I understood the matters of wisdom and courage some time ago. I am just now beginning to understand the matter
                        of compassion."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        That this stoic, gruff samurai traditionalist would say such a thing is compelling and shows his true understanding of good living. This
                        is a fundamental teaching of most eastern philosophy, and part of its origin can be seen in the Tao Te Ching. Stephen Mitchell comments
                        on this in his translation;
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "The teaching of the Tao Te Ching is moral in the deepest sense. Unencumbered by any concept of sin, the Master doesn't see evil as a force
                        to resist, but simply as an opaqueness; a state of self-absorption which is in disharmony with the universal process, so that, as with a
                        dirty window, the light can't shine through."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Anybody can tell you that other people are just people too, who have their own issues, and even the most troubled and dangerous are this way.
                        But to embody this understanding is true strength, which takes a lifetime to master. I tear up just writing this. I hope to have that
                        strength some day.

                        I've finally watched all of Friendship is Magic, as I fell out of bronydom around season 6. Since Everfree Northwest is still active, I've started attending, and it has rekindled a
                        fulfilling sense of belonging. It's funny seeing comments on brony songs and videos saying things like "Sad the good days of the fandom are gone" from 6 years ago - a time anyone in 2023 would kill to be in.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "It is said what is called "the spirit of an age" is something to which one cannot return. That this spirit gradually dissipates is due to the world's coming to an end.
                        In the same way, a single year does not have just spring or summer. A single day, too, is the same.<br />
                        For this reason, although one would like to change today's world to the spirit of one hundred years or more ago, it cannot be done. Thus it is important to make the best
                        out of every generation. This is the mistake of people who are attached to past generations. They have no understanding of this point."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>In the same way, to say ponies is dead in 2023 - when people still make songs, attend conventions, sell art - is just as funny.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Everyone lets the present moment slip by, then looks for it as though he thought it was somewhere else. No one seems to have noticed this fact."

                        The following is an old post from the previous version of this website. Not every post is worth bringing back, but I think this one is.
                    </p>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        I've taken up skateboarding in the past few months, and it's been very enriching. I love dexterity challenges, and riding around on a plank of wood
                        with wheels is about as dangerous and demanding one can get. I've been practicing dropping in; the act of starting atop a ramp, skateboard hung over the drop,
                        then mounting and descending on the board in one motion, shooting down the ramp and into the park with speed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The lesson this teaches is about fear. The drop is scary, and you feel you will fall forward off the board and down the ramp. However, show any hesitation and
                        you will undoubtedly fall backwards off the board instead - a far more dangerous way to fall. If you drop in, and lean very far forward despite feeling you will fall,
                        you will find it incredibly easy and that there was nothing to fear at all; yet hesitation to fear spells a worse failure than you could have imagined. It's like the saying
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Nothing is as scary as it seems""

                                    I recently got into Monster Hunter, beginning with Monster Hunter: World. The atmosphere is phenomenal, and
                                    wandering around each level is so engrossing. The title theme is an underrated part of this feeling.

                                    It captures the wonder and serenity of nature, with a hint of the story's themes of connection and belonging. It's
                                    a brilliant song to have on the title screen.

                                    I was speechless in this section of the story, and this music was perhaps the biggest reason why.
                                    The intense, mournful longing of the tragic Mare Lamentorum first half is perfectly shown in this song. <br />
                                    Speaking to those forlorn souls;
                                    each clinging to empty hope for thousands of years, staring helplessly at the looming, imprisoned Zodiark... It's this weight that made
                                    Emet Selch such a compelling character. My mouth hung open the entire time.

                                    This song stands out as a vaporwave treasure with its somber yet optimistic tone. To me, it is not a criticism
                                    or attack like most vaporwave. Using homey personal footage of beautiful shopping centers, it says:
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    It's audible nostalgia - not that it takes you back, blind to
                                    the present moment - but instead stays here and looks back soberly, yet so longingly.
