                        I've finally watched all of Friendship is Magic, as I fell out of bronydom around season 6. Since Everfree Northwest is still active, I've started attending, and it has rekindled a
                        fulfilling sense of belonging. It's funny seeing comments on brony songs and videos saying things like "Sad the good days of the fandom are gone" from 6 years ago - a time anyone in 2023 would be jealous to be in.

                    <blockquote>
                        "It is said what is called "the spirit of an age" is something to which one cannot return. That this spirit gradually dissipates is due to the world's coming to an end.
                        In the same way, a single year does not have just spring or summer. A single day, too, is the same.<br />
                        For this reason, although one would like to change today's world to the spirit of one hundred years or more ago, it cannot be done. Thus it is important to make the best
                        out of every generation. This is the mistake of people who are attached to past generations. They have no understanding of this point."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>In the same way, to say ponies is dead in 2023 - when people still make songs, attend conventions, sell art - is just as funny.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Everyone lets the present moment slip by, then looks for it as though he thought it was somewhere else. No one seems to have noticed this fact."
                    </blockquote>
