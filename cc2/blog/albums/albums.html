                        After finally watching it, I'm delighted by the newest generation of My Little Pony. The soundtrack
                        has some excellent entries, and if you were to just listen to the songs, you'd imagine the show is filled with
                        incredible melodrama. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This song is played as a good joke, but I always imagine it playing over some bittersweet
                        climax with dramatic sacrifice and a grandiose, anime level metaphor for unity and friendship.

                        A collection of quick beats dosed with sensual R&amp;B. This sort of sample heavy, jazzy lo-fi music is very comfortable to my internet-culture
                        sensibilities, as a former lo-fi hip-hop head.

                        The singing consistently kills it, but I would really like to point to <i>Hoursafter Intelude</i> for its creativity, talented singing and
                        atmosphere. It's impeccable jazz dive music, and this sort of tone is the highlight of the album for me.

                        This is one of my favorite albums ever. I found it by random chance on soundcloud, which I never visit.
                        It seems the titular song is quite popular but the others remain unheard, despite each being phenomenal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's a care-free, youthful tone across
                        the whole album that makes it feel dramatic and energizing, like a reckless but pure fight for a
                        naive happy ending that ends with a bittersweet life lesson. I can so easily imagine somber scenes,
                        impossible combat or moments of triumph perfectly directed by each song.

                        I have always dreamed of scoring a heavily metaphorical and
                        action-rich tokusatsu ttrpg campaign to these songs... I look forward to being a skilled enough GM
                        that I can make that story real.

                        This album has been in my life since it came out, when I was a young man.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The stories of each song, and the seriousness in Tyler's voice
                        spoke well to me. The tragedies of domestic abuse, failing relationships or getting too deep in the drug trade are
                        shown so beautifully and personally here. The amount of sadness and anger, back and forth, paint a great picture of the
                        mind of a troubled young man grappling with life...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Without a doubt, this album played a huge part in shaping my taste in drama 
                        and stories, with its emphasis on internal conflict and focus on very personal details.

                    Although not all music is heartfelt, there is no bad music. How could I
                    tell someone who has felt moved by music that they were wrong? What I
                    might dislike in music reflects only my own expectations, and it's impossible
                    to find a song that hasn't affected someones life positively, somehow. For this reason,
                    there is nothing bad to say about music.
