                    <p><b>Exceed</b> (AKA the <b>Exceed Fighting System</b>) <b>is a crossover fighting game in card game form!</b> It has the depth and interactivity of a fighting game with the variety and strategy of a card game, all in one. 
                    Pick a character, represented by a ~30 card deck, and fight your foe one-on-one, no arcade stick needed.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="ExceedSeller">
                    <h2>What makes Exceed special?</h2>
                    <p>As a crossover game, <b>Exceed features fighters from 11+ franchises</b>, including <b>Shovel Knight, Street Fighter, Blazblue and Dead Cells</b>, with each fighter meticulously
                    detailed to capture their nuance - and any fighter can fight any other, regardless of origin!</p>

                    <ul class="GamesList">

                        <li><p><i>...and more!</i></p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Exceed also captures the nuance of fighting games, with added card game strategy. 
                    Footsies evolve naturally as fighters try to get into their preferred attacks range. 
                    Hit attack cards go to Gauge, which is spent to use your powerful Ultra attacks. 
                    Each card in a figher's deck can be an attack, a boost or a resource, so every card has valuable uses.</p>

                    <p>There's a plethora of <b>careful details</b> too! Hadokens put themself back on top of your draw deck, so you can spam it in a projectile war. 
                    Hitting the opponent with the Sweep normal makes them discard a card, simulating okizeme by removing their options.</p>

                    <h3>Season 7 Update</h3>
                    <h4>May 30th, 2023</h4>
                    <p>The most recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPcArcMTdpY">Level Up Live</a> featured no mention of Bald Eagle (Season 7) or Exceed. 
                    Brad mentioned having the "prototype" in-hand for a project coming to Kickstarter in August. 
                    Some speculation believes this will be Season 7, but this is in contrast to the last official statement that Season 7 will be announced after Dead by Daylight finishes fulfillment, which will be far sooner.</p>
