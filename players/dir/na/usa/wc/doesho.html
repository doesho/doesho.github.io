                Doe creates custom content from character
                skins to playmats. He enjoys reading strategy for Exceed, and created playexceed.com hoping it could become a useful
                website in compiling community information and guides. This is the test page and features all default information filled in.
                I'll have to make this a dynamic website so people can make their own accounts and stuff, but I'm a far away from that.

            <p>
                I really like Quake 3 and CPMA. On the Level 99 Games survey I always answer Quake for the IP I wish they could get. It's never going to happen,
                and I know Level 99 do not know anything about Quake, but I think it would be cool. I tried making a Quake board game myself, but I am not
                clever enough. Perhaps I'll try it again some time...
