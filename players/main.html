    <h1>PLAYERS</h1>

    <p>
        This page will be an index of players, where they are located, characters they play, tournament results, etc. I guess I could let players make accounts and have their own profiles or something, but
        I have no clue how to do that. I think I'll just have players request to be on the website, what information they'll give and such. I'll update tournamnet results as they come out myself.
